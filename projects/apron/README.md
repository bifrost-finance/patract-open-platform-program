## Project Introduction

Apron Network is a decentralized infrastructure service platform built by employing Polkadot technology in the blockchain world. Apron has adopted the idea of being a decentralized platform which belongs to a middle service that provides a connection between the blockchain and the application software. It aims to make transactions for infrastructure software services simple, efficient, and reliable by connecting service providers and users in the decentralized service market.

## Wasm contract technical support

Apron will provide the Polkadot developers on the Patract with a decentralized API service.The core value of introducing decentralized API service into Patract platform is made available for the developers to deploy their nodes without a complicated setup, and they can use the service directly through the Apron SDK. The Apron SDK provides users with an effective dApp experience while minimizing cost by more automated operations, avoiding migrating all blocks, thereby facilitating a higher level of convenience.
